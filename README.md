## üñ•Ô∏è Console Smart Password Manager

A cross-platform command-line password manager that revolutionizes security by eliminating password storage. Built on deterministic cryptography principles, it generates passwords on-demand without ever storing them.

> **Powered by** [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib) - The core deterministic password generation library

Your passwords don't need to be stored because they were never created - they already exist as mathematical certainties, waiting to be discovered through the correct combination of login and secret phrase.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install clipassman
```

For systems with package conflicts:
```bash
pip install clipassman --break-system-packages
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Interactive Mode
```bash
clipassman
```

### Store Password Metadata
```bash
# Add a new smart password entry
clipassman --add --login "email@example.com" --length 16
# The system will prompt for your secret phrase
```

### Generate Password When Needed
```bash
# Generate password by providing secret phrase
clipassman --get --login "email@example.com"
# Enter your secret phrase when prompted
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### What's Stored (Publicly Safe)
- Login/identifier
- Password length
- Public verification key (cannot reveal password)

### What's Never Stored (Kept in Memory)
- Secret phrase
- Actual passwords
- Private keys

### Breach Protection
Even if attackers access your `.cases.json` file, they cannot:
- Recover your passwords
- Determine your secret phrase
- Generate future passwords

## üîÑ Ecosystem Integration

### Complementary Tools
- [**CLI PassGen**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/clipassgen/) - Console password generator
- [**SmartPassLib**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib/) - Core Python library
- [**Desktop Manager**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-password-manager-desktop) - Graphical interface
- [**Web Manager**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-password-manager) - Web-based interface

### Consistency Guarantee
Passwords generated with clipassman are identical to those generated by other ecosystem tools when using the same inputs.

## üíª Advanced Usage

### Batch Operations
```bash
# Add multiple accounts
clipassman --add --login "github" --length 20
clipassman --add --login "banking" --length 22
clipassman --add --login "email" --length 18

# Generate when needed
clipassman --get --login "github"
clipassman --get --login "banking"
```

### File Location
Password metadata is stored in: `~/.cases.json`

## ü§ù Supported Platforms

- **Linux** - All major distributions
- **Windows** - 7, 8, 10, 11
- **macOS** - Fully supported
- **Android** - Via Termux

## üêõ Troubleshooting
