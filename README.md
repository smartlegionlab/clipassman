## **🔐 Core Principles:**

- 🔐 **Zero-Password Storage**: No passwords are ever stored or transmitted
- 🔑 **Deterministic Regeneration**: Passwords are recreated identically from your secret phrase
- 📝 **Metadata Management**: Store only descriptions and verification keys
- 💻 **Terminal Processing**: All cryptographic operations happen in your CLI
- 🔄 **On-Demand Discovery**: Passwords exist only when you generate them

**What You Can Do:**
1. **Create Smart Passwords**: Generate deterministic passwords from secret phrases
2. **Store Metadata Securely**: Keep password descriptions and lengths without storing passwords
3. **Regenerate Passwords**: Recreate passwords anytime using your secret phrase
4. **Manage Services**: Organize passwords for different accounts and services
5. **Secure Terminal Input**: Hidden secret phrase entry with getpass
6. **Verify Secrets**: Prove knowledge of secrets without exposing them
7. **Export/Import**: Backup and restore your password metadata
8. **Cross-Platform Management**: Works on any system with Python
9. **No GUI Dependencies**: Pure terminal interface for servers and remote systems

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **No Password Database**: Eliminates password storage completely
- ✅ **Interactive Terminal UI**: Clean, centered text with visual framing
- ✅ **Public Key Verification**: Verify secret knowledge without exposure
- ✅ **List View**: See all your password metadata in clear lists
- ✅ **Export/Import**: Backup and restore functionality with timestamped files
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Clear all passwords with double confirmation
- ✅ **Secure Hidden Input**: Hidden secret phrase entry via getpass
- ✅ **No Dependencies**: Only Python standard library + smartpasslib
- ✅ **Server Ready**: Perfect for headless systems and remote management

**Security Model:**
- **Proof of Knowledge**: Verify you know a secret without storing it
- **Deterministic Security**: Same secret + length = same password, always
- **Metadata Separation**: Non-sensitive data stored separately from verification
- **Local Processing**: No data leaves your computer
- **No Recovery Backdoors**: Lost secret = permanently lost access (by design)

## 🔬 Technical Foundation

Powered by **[smartpasslib v2.2.0+](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib)** - The core library for deterministic password generation.

**Key principle**: Instead of storing passwords, you store verification metadata. The actual password is regenerated on-demand from your secret phrase.

**What's NOT stored**:
- Your secret phrase
- The actual password
- Any reversible password data

**What IS stored** (in `~/.config/smart_password_manager/passwords.json`):
- Public verification key (hash of secret)
- Service description
- Password length parameter

**Export format**: Same JSON structure, can be backed up and restored across different machines running the same software version.

**Security model**: Proof of secret knowledge without secret storage or password transmission.

## 📁 File Locations

Starting from v2.2.0, configuration files are stored in:

| Platform | Configuration Path |
|----------|-------------------|
| Linux | `~/.config/smart_password_manager/passwords.json` |
| macOS | `~/.config/smart_password_manager/passwords.json` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\Username\.config\smart_password_manager\passwords.json` |

**Automatic Migration**:
- Old `~/.cases.json` files are automatically migrated on first run
- Original file is backed up as `~/.cases.json.bak`
- Migration is one-time and non-destructive
- All your existing passwords are preserved

---

## 🆕 What's New in v2.2.0

### Import/Export Functionality

- **Export passwords**: Save your password metadata to JSON file with timestamp
- **Import passwords**: Restore from previously exported files
- **Format options**: Choose between pretty or minified JSON
- **Metadata inclusion**: Optional timestamp and version info in export
- **Safe import**: Merges with existing data, never overwrites existing entries
- **Import preview**: See export metadata before confirming
- **Statistics**: Clear feedback on added/skipped/invalid entries
- **Filename suggestions**: Auto-generated timestamps prevent overwrites

### Configuration Migration

- **New config location**: Now uses `~/.config/smart_password_manager/passwords.json`
- **Automatic migration**: Old `~/.cases.json` files are auto-migrated on first run
- **Cross-platform paths**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Safe backup**: Original file preserved as `.cases.json.bak`

### Improved Terminal UI

- **New menu option**: Export/Import in main menu (option 3)
- **Better feedback**: Clear statistics after import
- **Format selection**: Choose JSON format during export
- **Filename suggestions**: Auto-generated timestamps
- **Consistent visual styling** throughout the application

### Security Improvements

- **Stronger public key verification** using enhanced cryptographic methods
- **Better input validation** with clear error messages
- **Duplicate detection** - prevents creating multiple entries with same secret
- **Case-sensitive secrets** with clear user warnings

## 💡 Advanced Usage

### Password Management Strategy

**For Multiple Accounts:**
```bash
Description Examples:
- GitHub Personal Account
- Work Email - Office 365
- Social Media - Twitter
- Cloud Storage - Dropbox

Length Strategy:
- Critical accounts: 20-24 characters
- Important accounts: 16-20 characters
- General accounts: 12-16 characters
- Temporary accounts: 8-12 characters
```

### Secret Phrase Management

**Best Practices:**
1. **Unique per service** - Different secret for each account type
2. **Memorable but complex** - Phrases you can remember but others can't guess
3. **Case-sensitive** - v2.2.0 enforces exact case matching
4. **No digital storage** - Keep only in memory or physical backup
5. **Backup plan** - Physical written backup in secure location
6. **Export regularly** - Backup metadata after adding new passwords

**Example Secret Phrases:**
```
Good: "MyFavoriteCoffeeShop@2025#Boston"
Good: "PurpleElephantsDanceInMoonlight42"
Avoid: "password123", "letmein", "123456"
```

### Backup Strategy

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Export metadata after adding new passwords
2. Store exports in secure, encrypted location
3. Keep exports across different machines for synchronization
4. Test import on a separate machine before relying on backups
5. Use timestamped exports to maintain version history

- **Core Library Issues**: [smartpasslib Issues](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib/issues)
- **Documentation**: Inline help (option 5) and this README

**Note**: Always test password generation with non-essential accounts first. Implementation security depends on proper usage.

---

## ⚠️ Security Warnings

### Secret Phrase Security

**Your secret phrase is the cryptographic master key**

1. **Permanent data loss**: Lost secret phrase = irreversible loss of all derived passwords
2. **No recovery mechanisms**: No password recovery, no secret reset, no administrative override
3. **Deterministic generation**: Identical input (secret + length) = identical output (password)
4. **Single point of failure**: Secret phrase is the sole authentication factor for all passwords
5. **Secure storage required**: Digital storage of secret phrases is prohibited

**Critical**: Test password regeneration with non-essential accounts before production use

### Export/Import Security Notes

- Export files contain ONLY metadata (public keys, descriptions, lengths)
- No passwords or secret phrases are ever exported
- Export files are plain JSON - store them securely
- Treat exported metadata as sensitive information
- Timestamped exports help maintain backup history

        CLIPASSMAN v2.2.0 - Console Smart Password Manager

        BREAKING CHANGES WARNING:
        • Login parameter completely removed
        • Now uses ONLY secret phrase
        • All v1.x passwords are INVALID
        • Old password metadata cannot be migrated

        MIGRATION REQUIRED:
        If you have old passwords from v1.x:
        1. Recover them using v1.x version
        2. Generate new ones here with your secret phrases
        3. Update all accounts with new passwords
        4. Securely delete old password records

        HOW IT WORKS:
        1. Provide a secret phrase
        2. System generates a public key from the secret
        3. Password is generated deterministically
        4. Same secret + same length = same password every time

        To retrieve a password:
        1. Enter the same secret phrase
        2. Password is regenerated identically

        SECURITY NOTES:
        • Passwords are NEVER stored anywhere
        • Case-sensitive secret phrases
        • Lost secret phrase = permanently lost passwords
        • Public key can be stored for verification
