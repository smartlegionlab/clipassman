## 🖥️ Console Smart Password Manager

A cross-platform command-line smart password manager.

> **Powered by** [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib) - The core deterministic smart password generation library.

Your passwords don't need to be stored because they were never created - they already exist as mathematical certainties, waiting to be discovered through the correct combination of login and secret phrase.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install clipassman
```

For systems with package conflicts:
```bash
pip install clipassman --break-system-packages
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Interactive Mode
```bash
clipassman
```

### Store Password Metadata
```bash
# Add a new smart password entry
clipassman --add --login "email@example.com" --length 16
# The system will prompt for your secret phrase
```

### Generate Password When Needed
```bash
# Generate password by providing secret phrase
clipassman --get --login "email@example.com"
# Enter your secret phrase when prompted
```

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### What's Stored (Publicly Safe)
- Login/identifier
- Password length
- Public verification key (cannot reveal password)

### What's Never Stored (Kept in Memory)
- Secret phrase
- Actual passwords
- Private keys

### Breach Protection
Even if attackers access your `.cases.json` file, they cannot:
- Recover your passwords
- Determine your secret phrase
- Generate future passwords

## 🔄 Ecosystem Integration

### Complementary Tools
