Working with passwords has never been so secure.

## Short description:

___clipassman___ - Cross-platform console Smart Password manager and generator.

- Passwords are not stored anywhere, neither in open nor in encrypted form, they are generated on the fly.
- Complex passwords up to 1000 characters.
- The password does not need to be stored, memorized or written down anywhere, you only remember
a secret phrase that you keep in your head. 
- Only the login, password length and public key are stored in open form. 
These entries are stored in a .cases.json file in your home directory. 
If an attacker gains access to this file, they will not be able to obtain your passwords. 
You can only get passwords by knowing the secret phrase, and it is stored in your head. 
Or in any place that no one knows about, and cannot even assume that you are using 
this text as a secret phrase.

- Library for creating smart password generators and managers: [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib/)
- Console Smart Password Generator: [clipassgen](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/clipassgen/)
